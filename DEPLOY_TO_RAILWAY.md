# Deploying Pond Project to Railway

Great news! Your code is now hosted on GitHub at [bindu008-star/pond_project](https://github.com/bindu008-star/pond_project).

## Step 1: Create a Project on Railway
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app/) and log in (Github login is easiest).
2. Click **New Project** > **Deploy from GitHub repo**.
3. Select your repository: **`bindu008-star/pond_project`**.

## Step 2: Deploy
1. Click **Deploy Now**.
2. Railway will automatically detect the `Procfile` and `requirements.txt`.
3. Wait for the build to finish.

## Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Once deployed, Railway will generate a URL (check **Settings** > **Networking** if you don't see it).
2. Click the URL to open your app.

## Done!
No further configuration is needed because your repository now contains *only* the project files at the root level.
